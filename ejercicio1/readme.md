#Exercise  1

There's an array containing stock prices. Your task is to code a MaxProfit function that returns the maximum profit that could have been made by buying a stock at a price and then selling the stock later on (buy once, sell once). For example if the input is: [44, 30, 22, 32, 35, 30, 41, 38, 15] then your function should return 19, because if you bought the stock at $22 and sold it at $41, a profit of $19 was made, and this is the largest profit that could be made for this stock prices array. If there's no profit, return -1.
Examples:

A. Input: [44, 30, 22, 32, 35, 30, 41, 38, 15]
   Output: 19

B. Input: [2,3,4,2]
   Output: 2

C. Input: [50, 30, 4, 2]
   Output: -1
